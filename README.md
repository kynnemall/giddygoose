## Giddy Goose Apps

### Why?
I have some friends who ask interesting questions that I can potentially solve and make some cool graphs while I'm at it.
I also need somewhere to keep track of all the nanoprojects that crop up so this seemed like a good idea at the time.

### What?
In this repo, you may find some incredibly useful things. Just maybe. I can't guarantee anything . . .

### Questions addressed so far
1. A simulator to estimate the probability that N random women will be on their period at the same time
2. An ML app to classify baked goods as either biscuit, cake, bread, or pastry
3. A simple next letter generator using Markov Models
4. <em>In Progress:<em> TBD
