## Giddy Goose Apps

### Why?
I have some friends who ask interesting questions that I can potentially solve and make some cool graphs while I'm at it.
I also need somewhere to keep track of all the nanoprojects that crop up.

## What?
In this repo, you may find some incredibly useful things. Just maybe. I can't guarantee anything . . .
